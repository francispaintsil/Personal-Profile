                During my final MSc project work at RGU, I delivered a project on the identification of SQLi vulnerabilities in web application using the best methodology available. This involved analysing various tools available online with known capability to curb the vulnerability menace and narrowing the result of the various tools analysed, to the most effective penetration tool available.  
                Finally, I set up a virtual lab to demonstrate the effectiveness of the selected vulnerability tools, such as SQLMap for conducting penetration test to identify various vulnerabilities existing on selected web application from the OWASP site.
